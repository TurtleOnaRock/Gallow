This project is one of seven steps on practice java backend roadmap.
Roadmap was designed by https://github.com/zhukovsd.

Gallow is the first task. It's command line words game where you should try to guess a secret word letter by letter.
Main language of the game is russian. You can make 6 mistakes, each mistake draws the gallow. 
After one game's session the game offer you the next word or quit.
